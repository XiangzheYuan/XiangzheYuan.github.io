My name is Xiangzhe Yuan (You can try pronouncing it like this: 'Shan Jer You-en',Ë¢ÅÊπòÂì≤). I am currently a PhD student in the CS department at UIowa.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Collaboration, and Responsible AI. I have been a science fiction enthusiast since childhood, influenced by many sci-fi books, movies and anime. This early exposure sparked my curiosity about advanced technologies such as AI and robotics, and it continues to shape my research interests today.  I've worked a bit on the technical side of AI and now on the human-centered side, so I sometimes see problems from a different angle (at least I like to think so üòÖ).
