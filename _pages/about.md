My last name is Yuan, and my first name is Xiangzhe, so in Chinese, my name is Yuan Xiangzhe (袁湘哲). It might be hard to pronounce(Yuán Xiāng Zhé), so you can try saying **'You-en Shan Jer'** instead.

Currently I 'm a visiting student at SUST,supervised by [Prof.Pengcheng An](https://anpengcheng.cn/). I have close collaboration with Dr. Siying Hu. I was a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Zhicong Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/). Prior to this, I completed my MSc in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University, supervised by [Prof. Lu Zhang](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ericluzhang/).
