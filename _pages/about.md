My last name is Yuan, and my first name is Xiangzhe, so in Chinese, my name is Yuan Xiangzhe (袁湘哲). It might be hard to pronounce(Yuán Xiāng Zhé), so you can try saying **'You-en Shan Jer'** instead.

I was a visiting student at the School of Design at the Southern University of Science and Technology, as well as a RA in the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong. I completed my MSc in the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University, supervised by [Prof. Lu Zhang](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ericluzhang/).
